## Introduction

Ente is a fully open-source, end-to-end encrypted platform that allows you to securely store your data in the cloud without needing to trust the service provider. We prioritize your privacy and ensure that only you have access to your data. Ente currently offers two apps: Ente Photos and Ente Auth, with more planned for the future.

## Why Ente?

- End-to-end encryption: Your data is encrypted on your device before it reaches our servers, ensuring that only you can access it.
- Open-source: Our source code is publicly available for scrutiny, fostering transparency and trust.
- Enhanced privacy: We minimize data collection and protect your personal information from unauthorized access.
- User control: You have full control over your data and can choose to self-host if desired.
