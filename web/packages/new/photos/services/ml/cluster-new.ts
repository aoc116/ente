/**
 * Cluster faces into groups.
 *
 * [Note: Face clustering algorithm]
 *
 * A cgroup (cluster group) consists of clusters, each of which itself is a set
 * of faces.
 *
 *     cgroup << cluster << face
 *
 * The clusters are generated locally by clients using the following algorithm:
 *
 * 1.  clusters = [] initially, or fetched from remote.
 *
 * 2.  For each face, find its nearest neighbour in the embedding space.
 *
 * 3.  If no such neighbour is found within our threshold, create a new cluster.
 *
 * 4.  Otherwise assign this face to the same cluster as its nearest neighbour.
 *
 * This user can then tweak the output of the algorithm by performing the
 * following actions to the list of clusters that they can see:
 *
 * -   They can provide a name for a cluster ("name a person"). This upgrades a
 *     cluster into a "cgroup", which is an entity that gets synced via remote
 *     to the user's other clients.
 *
 * -   They can attach more clusters to a cgroup ("merge clusters")
 *
 * -   They can remove a cluster from a cgroup ("break clusters").
 *
 * After clustering, we also do some routine cleanup. Faces belonging to files
 * that have been deleted (including those in Trash) should be pruned off.
 *
 * We should not make strict assumptions about the clusters we get from remote.
 * In particular, the same face ID can be in different clusters. In such cases
 * we should assign it arbitrarily assign it to the last cluster we find it in.
 * Such leeway is intentionally provided to allow clients some slack in how they
 * implement the sync without needing to make an blocking API request for every
 * user interaction.
